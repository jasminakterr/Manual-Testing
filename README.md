## Test Plan
At first done the test planning for better understanding about the project and overview all over the app. Writing a test plan for manual testing is crucial for organizing and standardizing the testing process. It ensures that testing is thorough, consistent, and aligned with the projectâ€™s objectives.  So that when write test cases it helps to understand the functionality.

## Test Scenarios
Writing test scenarios for manual testing is an essential step in the quality assurance process. Test scenarios help ensure that all possible actions and workflows within the application are tested effectively.

## Test Case Writing
Main part of the project. After doing all the things that helps to write and execute the test cases more specific. In this project all the test cases have been executed without having any delay. 
- **Total Test Cases:** 104  
- **Passed:** 94  
- **Failed:** 10
 
## Test Summary
A test summary for manual testing is an essential part of the testing lifecycle. It provides a comprehensive overview of the testing process, outcomes, and overall product quality.

## Bug Report
Bug reports is a critical activity in manual testing, as it provides a structured way to document and communicate issues discovered during the testing process. The number of bugs discovered in test case writing is concentrated in this section. As we already know from the previous section (Test Case Writing), 10 test cases failed. #SL-11,22,23,24,27,28,29,36,68,88 denotes the errors identified.
## Known Issues
1. **UI Focus Issue:** Fields do not visually highlight when clicked (Sign Up page).  
2. **Input Validation Errors:** Special characters are accepted in name fields.  
3. **CAPTCHA Missing:** CAPTCHA implementation is absent on the Login page.

## Test Metrics
Test metrics for manual testing is essential for measuring, analyzing, and improving the testing process and the overall quality of the product. Test metrics provide quantifiable data to track the progress, efficiency, and effectiveness of testing activities.
- **Execution Rate:** 100%  
- **Pass Rate:** 90.4%  
- **Fail Rate:** 9.6%
